# Noter

### Description
Noter is simple application for sharing notes. I used React on frontend, and Node.js deployed on a few AWS Lambdas on backend.
In this project I used also other AWS services, like ApiGateway, Cognito, DynamoDB and Simple Email Service.

### Features
- Signup and sign in page managed by Cognito on backed
- notes creation
- sharing notes with other people (to view note account is required)
- define note expiration
- notification, when someone share note with you

### Deployment

### TODO
